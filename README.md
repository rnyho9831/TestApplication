# learnrubythehardway
Files from my Learn Ruby The Hard Way course Repo to store our exercises.

Suggested naming convention for files is "ex[number of exercise].[number of the study lesson]-[initials].rb". For example, file ex15.1-gs.rb would contain all the answers the Grace submitted for exercise 15 study lesson #1.
