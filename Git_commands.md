Git Commands via command line terminal

*git status* - shows where I'm at.  If you're ahead, you need to push.  If you're behind, you need to "pull"

*git checkout master* - puts me on the master branch of the repo.

*git pull origin master* - pulls all of the code on that branch of the repo (in this case "master")
-- make changes to file, one at a time.
*git add* "ex1/ex1-rn.rb" - adds file to repository

NOTE *git add ** - only ADDS all files, not removes

*git commit -m "Message for commit"*

*git push origin master*

*git status* -- run again to make sure that there is nothing to commit.  Ensures you're up-to-date with master branch


$ git rm "ex1/ex1.rb"  --unix command to remove
$ git add "ex1/ex1-rn.rb" - adds file to repository
$ git add * - only ADDS all files, not removes
